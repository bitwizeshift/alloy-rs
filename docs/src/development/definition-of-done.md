# Definition of Done

This outlines the basic checklist of requirements to state that a task has been
"completed".

## Checklist

* [ ] The change has been tested by CI and passes all failing tests
* [ ] If the change introduced new code, the new code has been tested
* [ ] If the change is fixing a bug in old code, the bug has been recreated in
      a unit test and has been verified
