**Alloy** does not log, collect, process, or share any personal or user data

In short: we don't track you, and we don't profile you. **Period.*

However, it is important to note that **Github**, which hosts this project,
*does* collect some aggregated metrics for the project -- such as clones, views,
stars, etc. -- which are visible to contributors.

You can read more about this in [Github's Privacy Policy].
