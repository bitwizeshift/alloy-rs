# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in this project! I sincerely appreciate your
enthusiasm and eagerness to contribute, as public contributions are
fundamental to the open-source community.

However, at this moment, I am **not actively accepting external contributions**.
This project primarily exists to experiment and learn about game engine design
in Rust -- and as such has a much looser focus and roadmap that is
currently aligned with specific goals.

It is possible that this may change in the future; so please consider starring
this project to keep an eye on future updates for opportunities to contribute
and collaborate. Your support and understanding are highly valued.
