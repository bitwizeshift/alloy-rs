# Project Governance

This project is a hobby-project I started for myself ([@bitwizeshift]), used as
a learning opportunity for designing a videogame engine in Rust.

## Decision Process

Whether or not an idea or feature-request will be implemented will largely
come down to two criteria:

1. Is the feature something feasible to do in the spare time I have on weekends
   or after work?
2. Is the feature something fun to work on, and gratifying enough to receive
   positive returns after the fact?

Since this is something that must retain my interest in my spare time, it's
important that this is reasonable to do and "fun" to achieve the result of.

**Note:** It is likely that, in the future, this project will grow to have a
proper contribution policy so that others may provide back to this project.
However, while this is still a hobby project for fun, the goal is for this to be
a learning experience for myself.
