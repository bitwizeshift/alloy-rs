            👋🏻 Hi, thank you for your interest in this project.

            I sincerely appreciate your enthusiasm and eagerness to contribute,
            as public contributions are fundamental to the open-source community.

            However, at this moment, I am **not actively accepting external
            contributions**. This project primarily exists to experiment and
            learn about game engine design in Rust -- and as such has a much
            looser focus and roadmap that is currently aligned with specific
            goals.

            It is possible that this may change in the future; so please consider
            starring this project to keep an eye on future updates for
            opportunities to contribute and collaborate. Your support and
            understanding are highly valued.

            This project does have [💬 Github Discussion][discussions] enabled
            if there are suggestions for improvements or reasonable feature
            requests.

            [discussions]: https://github.com/{{github.repo}}/discussions

            Thank you! 🙇‍♂️
