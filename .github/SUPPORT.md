## Bug Reports

When submitting bug reports, please include the following information:

* Version of the project you are using.
* A clear description of the issue.
* Steps to reproduce the problem.
* Any error messages or logs related to the issue.

## Feature Requests

For feature requests, please provide a detailed explanation of the proposed
feature and why you believe it would be valuable. This helps the maintainers
understand your needs and consider the request.

## Support Scope

* **Community Support**: The project maintainers and the community will provide
best-effort support, but there is no guarantee of response time or resolution.

* **Security Concerns**: If you discover a security vulnerability, please report
it through a normal [Github issue]. This project does not work with confidental
data, and is not a high-risk system; so the surface-area for security issues is
low.

## Pull Requests

This project is **not** currently accepting contributions.
Although this will likely change in the future, please respect the wishes of the
author -- as this is primarily meant as a fun side-project to learn more about
writing a game engine in Rust.

If you still wish to contribute, consider opening a [Discussion] instead.
